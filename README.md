Titanic Survival Prediction
Overview
This project predicts the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes demographic and travel information for passengers, and the goal is to build a model that predicts whether a passenger survived or not.

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:git@github.com:ipsitanayak486/Titanic--Survival-Prediction.git

2.Download the dataset:

Download the dataset from Kaggle (requires Kaggle account).

Usage
Data Preparation and Model Training

Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
Explore and preprocess the data in the Jupyter notebook (notebooks/Titanic_Survival_Prediction.ipynb) or using the Python script (src/titanic_model.py).

Training the Model:
Train a logistic regression model using the prepared dataset to predict survival outcomes.

Prediction
After training, use the trained model to predict survival outcomes on new data or the test set.

Dependencies
Python 3.x
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib (for data visualization in notebooks)
